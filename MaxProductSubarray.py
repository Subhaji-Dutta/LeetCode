# Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

# Note that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

# Solve
